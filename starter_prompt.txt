I would like to build an app to help insurance agents reach out to their potential custoemers and help their customers finalise a plan that is suitable for them. The insurance agents need help in the following aspects
1.  Managing the leads that have been assigned to them
2. Managing the various products that are available to them along with their details
3. Managing calendar to dial prospects based on the times specified by them
4. Having a voice conversation and understanding the current needs of a prospect
5. Proposing a product that is right for the needs of a prospect
6. Getting contact details like Email and sending a detailed personalised prospectus for the customer

Addition Requirements
1. Allow the agent to add all relevant product information
2. Allow various product categories to be created and show the documents category wise
3. Add support for model selection and API keys in an admin UI. 

Technical Inputs
1. The voice call should be initiated by a bot (the sales agent) and it should ask questions that will try and identify the needs of the customer. 
2. Based on what the user responds, the bot should look up relevant products from its vector store and suggest
3. Based on user's inputs build a prospectus 
4. The Bot should be empathetic and not pushy
5. For voice bot, make use of Realtime API from OpenAI. 
6. For text based LLM, make use of OpenAI APIs
7. Make the DB configurations configurable
8. Build the application using Spring Boot and use Spring AI
9. Make this follow docker convention
10. Support Github Actions to enable continuous deployment

Build a detailed prompt for building the above application using Claude Code. 
Make sure all requirements related to the front end, backend and DB are captured.
